commons4s
=========

`commons4s` contains utility classes I wrote in Scala over the years.
There are more in my private repositories, but I haven't had a chance to clean them up,
so I'm just releasing the ones that I need for the pet project I'm currently working on for now. 
I use Scala 2.12.x for the project so it is compiled with Scala 2.12,
but it shouldn't be too difficult to downgrade, upgrade, or cross-compile.

More details to come.

GitHub Packages
---------------
The compiled artifacts are published to GitHub as a Maven project.

Note that GitHub's autogenerated POM snippet is buggy and misleading.

In a Maven project, add 
```xml
<repository>
  <id>chrism_github</id>
  <name>chrism GitHub commons4s</name>
  <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/chrismin1202/commons4s</url>
</repository>
```
as a `<repository>` and include
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.chrism</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons4s_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>CHECK_build.sbt_FOR_LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```
as a `<dependency>`.

In a sbt project, add 
```
resolvers += "chrism commons4s GitHub Package Registry" at "https://maven.pkg.github.com/chrismin1202/commons4s"
```
as a resolver and include
```
libraryDependencies += "com.chrism" %% "commons4s" % "check.build.sbt.for.latest"
```
as a library dependency.
